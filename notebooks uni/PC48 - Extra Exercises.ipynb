    "Write a program that asks for a number between 100 and 999, with the first digit of the number being different from the last.

Call this number `DEF`, with `D`, `E`, and `F` being the digits. Then create `FED`. Add `DEF` to `FED`, and print the result.

So I won't blame you if you skip it. To solve it, you have to create all different combinations of keys. There is a function `combinations()` in the `itertools` module that can help you with it. This module is discussed in the chapter on Iterators and Generators, which falls under Object Orientation, but you do not need to know anything about object orientation to understand it.

    "The Towers of Hanoi is a puzzle, which uses three poles, labeled A, B, and C. On pole A there is a stack of discs of varying size; the discs are numbered according to their size. The smallest disc is 1, the next one is 2, the next one is 3, etcetera, up to size `N`. Typical values for `N` are 4 and 5, though in the classic puzzle `N` is supposed to be 64. The discs are stacked on pole A according to their size, the smallest one on top, and the biggest one on the bottom. You now have to move all the discs from pole A to pole C, whereby you have to follow these four rules: (1) you can only move one disc at a time; (2) you can only move discs between the poles; (3) you can only move a disc from a pole if it is on top, and can only move it to the top of another pole; and (4) you can never place a disc on top of a disc that is smaller. Write a program that solves this puzzle for any value of `N` (for testing purposes, `N` should not be chosen higher than 10 or so). Make the program print the solution as a recipe, with lines such as \"Move disc 1 from pole A to pole C\".

But how do you solve the problem with the biggest disc being size 9? Well, that is simple if you know how to solve it for size 8... You can imagine where this is going. You are reducing the complexity of the problem step by step, until you are at \"solving the problem for size 2 is simple if you can solve it for size 1.\" Solving it for size 1 is trivial: you just move the disc to where it must go.

    "Write a program that changes the spelling of a text according to these rules. Make sure that if a word starts with a capital, a replacement retains that capital; e.g., if a sentence starts with \"You\", you should make it start with \"U\" (and not \"u\"). It is a good idea to do this exercise with regular expressions."
