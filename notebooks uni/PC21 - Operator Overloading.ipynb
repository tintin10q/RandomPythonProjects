    "When you write Python programs with basic data types, without thinking you use operators to add, subtract, multiply, and divide values, to compare values, and to apply all kinds of standard functionalities to values. Such interactions are not defined by default for classes you define yourself, but Python allows you to specify what should happen when one applies such an interaction to instances of your class. This is called \"operator overloading\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, suppose that you define a class that represents complex numbers (I introduced those when discussing tuples). You know that adding and multiplying complex numbers are well-defined operations. Therefore, you might want to define what happens when you combine two of your complex numbers with a `+` operator. Python allows you to specify that. In fact, Python allows you to specify what the `+` operator does for any of your new classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isn't that great? You can define a class `Student`, and then define that if you add two students together with a `+` operator, that their ages are added up. Wonderful, isn't it? No, it isn't. It obviously makes no sense to add up two students. You might start thinking about what a natural interpretation of adding up two students would entail, but the answer is that everything that you can come up with is far-fetched. You should not define an addition operator for classes which have no natural addition defined. This is one of the dangers of operator overloading: if you apply it without thinking, you get nonsensical programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, operator overloading has powerful applications. In the rest of this chapter I will introduce some of the applications of operator overloading. There are more than I discuss here, but I will bring up the most common ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, operator overloading is a typical example of \"polymorphism\", a concept that allows a function to have different results depending on the type of its arguments. Polymorphism is often hailed as one of the powerful features of object orientation."

Normally, when the comparison operator is defined, it will be executed for the left operand, i.e., the comparison operator of the integer `3` is executed, with `c3` as argument. However, integers have not defined the `__eq__()` method for `Complex`, and thus this returns `NotImplemented`. If that happens, Python inverts the operands, and thus, in this case, executes the comparison `c3 == 3`. This comparison leads to a result as for `Complex` the comparison with an integer is defined. The same happens with the `!=` operator. Something similar is done for the other comparison operators, but when the operands are inverted, `<` is swapped with `>`, and `<=` is swapped with `>=`, just as you would expect.\n",

Test the new operators. Note: I am a bit on the fence on whether these are acceptable definitions for equality and the other comparisons, but for practice it is okay."

Unfortunately, that cannot be done, as these methods must return integers or floats, and not `Complex` numbers.

Such classes contain a sequence of elements, that can be accessed using indices or keys. You can create such classes yourself, by overloading several methods that support getting information on the elements of the class.\n",

    "- `__len__()` implements the `len()` function, which should return an integer that indicates the number of elements in the object.\n",
    "- `__getitem__()` implements returning the element with the key (or index) that is supplied as argument. This method is called when the object is referred to with a value between square brackets after it, e.g., `x[key]` with `x` the object and `key` the key or index of the element. If `key` is an index and the index is not appropriately referring to an object, then you are supposed to raise an `IndexError` (see the chapter on exceptions). If `key` is something else (as with, for instance, a dictionary) and it is not appropriately referring to an object, then you are supposed to raise a `KeyError`. When `key` is an index, for a complete implementation it should also support slices (implemented as so-called slice objects).\n",
    "- `__setitem__()` implements assigning a value to an element of the object which has the key that is given as argument. This method is called when a value is assigned to the object with a value between square brackets after it, e.g., `x[key] = value`.\n",
    "- `__delitem__()` implements removing an element from the object with the key that is given as argument, when the `del` keyword is used, e.g., `del x[key]`.\n",
    "- `__missing__()` is called by `__getitem__()`, with the key as argument, when the key is not referring to an element found in the object. This method is used in particular by subclasses of the Python dictionary.\n",
    "- `__contains__()` should be given an item (and *not* a key) as argument, and returns `True` if the item is found in object, and `False` otherwise. It is called when the `in` keyword is used to test for the existence of an item.\n",

    "To demonstrate how these methods work, I have implemented a sequence class that implements a Mesostic Puzzle. In Dutch, such puzzles are known as \"Filippines\", but it seems that outside The Netherlands and Belgium they are not well known. The puzzle consists of a list of questions, each of which is answered by one word. Of each answer, one letter is indicated as \"special\". The special letters, in order of the questions, provide the solution to the puzzle.\n",

I implemented the `__len__()`, `__getitem__()`, `__setitem__()`, and `__delitem__()` methods (the last two are not actually used in the code).\n",

    "I also implemented two more methods, which demonstrate how the overloaded methods manage to do their job. `display()` displays the puzzle, and uses thereby the `len()` function and indices on the puzzle object itself. `solution()` displays the solution, also using `len()` and indices."
