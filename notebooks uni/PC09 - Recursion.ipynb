    "This might sound weird when you first encounter it, but there is nothing against a function calling other functions, and a function can call any function that has been defined by the time that the call takes place.

    "At this point in the course it is hard to give a good demonstration of recursion, as it needs particular data structures to show its power. But to still show something non-trivial, I have included a module called `pcmaze`. This module implements a simple maze, which connects some numbered cells. You can ask for the maze's entrance using the function `entrance()`. The maze's exit is given by the function `exit()` (not to be confused with the `exit()` function from `sys`). The module also has a function `connected()` that gets two arguments: it returns `True` if there is a direct connection between the cells with those numbers, and `False` otherwise. The entrance is guaranteed to be the lowest-numbered cell, while the exit is guaranteed to be the highest-numbered cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to write some code that finds the way from the entrance to the exit (if there is such a way).\n",

Recursively, you can do it as follows: You define a function `leads_to_exit()` that returns a path to the exit if the cell that it is currently examining is on the path that leads to the exit. If that function returns a path, then you know that the current cell is also on the path.\n",

    "\n",
    "You have to be careful that such a recursive definition cannot get stuck in a circular path in the maze. That means, in the maze above, that when the function moves from cell `A` to cell `B`, it is not allowed to move back. If that is taken care of, the function should work. It wouldn't work if there would be circular paths in the maze, but fortunately there aren't. The problem is not unsolvable if there are circular paths, but to solve it a data structure is needed that is not discussed yet.\n",

In the implementation immediately below, the path will not be returned, but I return just `True` or `False` to indicate that the path is found or not, and I print the path in the function itself (a bit further down I provide the complete implementation for the pseudo-code above)."
