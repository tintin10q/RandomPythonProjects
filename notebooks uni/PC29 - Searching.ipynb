Why that is, will be discussed in the next chapter, in which it is relevant to understand exactly how Python has implemented lists.\n",

After each number that the second player guesses, the first player says whether the number that he picked is lower, higher, or equal to the guessed number.\n",

    "A method to guess the number is by starting at 1, and then increasing by 1 after every guess. This method is `O(n)`, as it emulates linear search. However, since the number is picked from a *sorted* list (it is sorted because the first player can say \"lower\" or \"higher\" after every guess), it is possible to identify the target number more efficiently. You probably see how, but I will make it explicit:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that the first player picked 278. The second player first divides the range of numbers 1-1000 into two ranges and one number that is between the ranges, namely: 1-499, 500, and 501-1000. The single number in the middle is used as guess, i.e., 500. The first player says that the target is \"lower\". This means that now the range of numbers that needs to be searched is 1-499. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second player then divides the remaining range again into two (almost) equal parts, and the middle number: 1-249, 250, and 251-499.

    "The guessing continues, each guess dividing the range to search into half of what it was previously. By the time the length of the range is 1, the number has been guessed. This happens in the worst case after `log`<sub>2</sub>`(n)+1` guesses, whereby `n` is the size of the original range. For 1000 numbers, this is 10 guesses at most. \n",

    "\n",
    "A hash table consists of a list of a specific size. Let's call the size of the list `N`. An element must be stored in the hash table with a particular \"key\", for instance a string. A so-called \"hash function\" is used to turn that key into a number (how exactly it does that I will not go into here, just assume that there is a hash function that may turn any string into some number, whereby different strings tends to get different numbers). Let's call this number `H`. The element is then stored in the list at index `H%N` (`H` modulo `N`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, to detect whether an element with a particular key exists in the hash table, you translate that key with the hash function to its associated number `H`, and check whether there is something stored in the hash table at `H%N`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there are many issues with this procedure. It is very well possible that two different keys end up being hashed to the same number. It is even more likely that two different hash numbers end up at the same index in the hash table. Moreover, even if it would be guaranteed that all hash numbers translate to different indices, at some point the hash table will be completely filled up, and where are new elements going to be stored then?\n",
    "\n",
    "The issues mentioned are solved as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the problem that two different keys lead to the same hash number, the solution is that in the hash table each element is stored as a tuple with the key. Therefore, when you find an element in the hash table, you can check whether indeed it has the key that you are looking for.\n",
    "- For the problem that two or more elements might be mapped to the same index in the hash table, the solution is that if an element needs to get stored at an index where already an element is stored (called a \"collision\"), a so-called \"perturbation\" value is added to the index to create another index. If that slot is empty, the element gets stored in it. If it is full, repeatedly the perturbation value is added to the index, until an empty slot is found. This is called \"probing\". \n",
    "- For the problem of the hash table getting filled up, the solution is that once the hash table is filled for a particular percentage (e.g., `70%`), a bigger hash table is created and all elements are moved to the new table. Naturally, this can be an expensive operation."

What is essential, though, is that `N` is a prime number. The reason is that, with `N` being a prime number, it is certain that a procedure which seeks new indices using the perturbation value, will never get into a loop whereby it checks indices that it already checked before, unless the hash table is completely filled.\n",
    "- For `FACTOR`, usually a value around `0.7` is picked. The reason is that this value is high enough to ensure that there aren't too many open slots in the table, while low enough to ensure that in the case of collisions, empty slots are detected within very few tries.\n",
    "- For `PERTURB`, it does not matter much which value is picked, so usually `1` is used. This is called \"linear probing\". The disadvantage of linear probing is that probing might run into long sequences of filled slots. To avoid this, more complex methods need to be implemented to deal with collisions, e.g., \"double hashing\" (at the end of this chapter there is an exercise about that).\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the hash function, to make it suitable you basically have to know what kind of keys are possible. Preferably, two keys which are quite similar get very different hash numbers. Also, you want hash numbers not to be clustered to much. Creating such a hash function is not easy. For instance, for a string key, adding up the ordinal values of the characters in the string does not make a good hash function. The reason is that short strings will all end up with low hash numbers. Moreover, anagrams will all end up with the same number. \n",

    "First, an element is stored with the key \"apple\". This element ends up at index 10. Second, an element is stored with the key \"banana\". This element ends up at the same hash number as \"apple\", so it gets stored at index 11 (with \"linear probing\" and a perturbation value of 1). Then, the key \"cherry\" is used to store an element, which again ends up with the same hash number, and thus gets stored at index 12. \n",

    "The implementation above uses the `count()` method to determine the number of empty slots in the table. This is not a good idea, as `count()` is an expensive operation (it is `O(n)`). However, `count()` can be avoided by keeping track of the number of filled slots (easily achievable by implementing the hash table as a class, which I did not do above so that I would not have to bother about all the overhead methods that using a class brings with it). So I assume that `count()` is not part of the hash table algorithm.\n",

    "The worst-case scenario is that the hash table is completely filled up, and all the keys get mapped to the same hash number, and the last element of the chain is searched for. In that case, all elements of the table get traversed. This means that finding elements in a hash table is `O(n)` in these circumstances. However, hash tables have been designed to avoid this happening. Not only are they never completely filled, but the hashing is designed to map keys to different indices. Naturally, the more elements in the table, the higher the chance that there is a collision. But even a collision is not that bad: it only becomes bad if too many collisions happen with the same index.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a proper hash function and a properly designed hash table, storing elements in the table and finding them leads to no collisions, or at worst 2 or 3. In that case, storing and looking up keys are `O(1)`. If you find that you get substantially more than, say, 2 collisions on average, there are two situations to consider:\n",

    "Better than linear probing, is using a second hash function for determining the perturbation value for a hash table. This is called \"double hashing\". The advantage is that collisions whereby different keys end up at the same index, use different chains to seek for empty slots. The second hash function, which is only used to determine the perturbation value, can usually be simpler than the one that determines the hash number. A possible second hash number for strings is to take the ordinal values for the first and the last character of the string, and add them up. You just have to make sure that the perturbation value, when taken modulo the size of the table, is not zero, otherwise you will get into endless loops. Change the example implementation that I give above to encompass double hashing."
