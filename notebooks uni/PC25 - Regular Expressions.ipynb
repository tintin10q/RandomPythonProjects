    "When you are facing a problem with text mining, data processing, finding patterns in large collections of data, or scraping data from web pages, and you explore the Internet to find a solution to your problem, you will find that often the very first answer given to questions in this respect is \"Why don't you use regular expressions?\" or even \"Just use regex\", without further explanations. Rather smug answers, as many people have never heard of regular expressions, and if they have, might find them scary and incomprehensible. In fact, at first glance they come over as so arcane and confusing that most people rather shy away than delve into them. Which is a pity, as regular expressions are a powerful tool that should not be missing in the toolbox of anyone who deals with unstructured data on a regular basis.\n",

    "In this chapter I will explain how to write and use basic regular expressions with Python. You will find them indeed a powerful way to quickly express and discover complex and diverse patterns in data, providing access to functionalities that would be very hard to implement in vanilla Python. While this chapter does not contain a complete overview of regular expressions, after studying it you will be able to understand and use regular expressions for most, if not all, pattern-matching problems that you encounter in practice, and be confident in telling the uninitiated: \"You should use regular expressions to solve your problems.\" <i>Now you can feel smug too!</i> "

This is mainly necessary when the regular expression contains \"`\\b`\", which for regular expressions means \"word boundary\" (I will get to that later in this chapter), but for Python means \"backspace\". So it is good practice to always put that \"`r`\" in front of a regular expression, to avoid problems.\n",

    "Suppose that you have to create a regular expression that represents a string that contains an arbitrary non-space character twice. For instance, the string \"regular\" would not have a match, but the string \"expression\" would (as it contains two \"e\"s and two \"s\"s. This cannot be done with the regular expression features that we discussed until now. It can be solved, however, with groups, and special references within a regular expression, namely as follows: using the special sequence `\\x`, whereby `x` is a number, you refer to the group with index `x` in the match. Thus, a regular expression that represents a string with an arbitrary non-space character twice is `(\\S).*\\1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since at this point this regular expression might still be a bit hard to understand, let's look at it in depth. The `\\S` is a special sequence that represent a non-space character. Putting it in parentheses turns it into a group, and since this is the first (and only) group in the expression, its index is 1. The `.*` represents a sequence of zero or more characters, which can be anything (the period is a meta-character that represents any character). Finally, the `\\1` refers to the first group, and says that here you want to have exactly the same thing as the first group represents. If you are wondering why you do not need to represent anything that can be placed before the `\\S`, or anything that can come after the `\\1`, then the answer is that you are not specifying that this regular expression represents a string as a whole, so as long as it occurs anywhere in the string, it matches.\n",
